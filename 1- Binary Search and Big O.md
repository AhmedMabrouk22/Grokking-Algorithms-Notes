### Big O notation tells you how fast an algorithm
Big O notation lets you compare the number of operations. It tells you how fast the algorithm grows
This tells you the number of operations an algorithm will make.

#### Some common Big O run times
- O(log n), also known as log time. Example: Binary search.
- O(n), also known as linear time. Example: Simple search.
- O(n * log n). Example: A fast sorting algorithm, like quicksort.
- O(n^2). Example: A slow sorting algorithm, like selection sort.
- O(n!). Example: A really slow algorithm, like the traveling salesperson.

- Algorithm speed isnâ€™t measured in seconds.
- Algorithm times are measured in terms of growth of an algorithm.
